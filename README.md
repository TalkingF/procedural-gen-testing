# Procedural Gen Testing

This repository contains a small collection of tests related to procedural generation and other topics. **The projects are very much WIP and may not represent finished, polished demonstrations, but rather a workspace to try out these concepts**.

The repo currently contains the following sub-projects...

## terrain-testing (godot)

A first test on procedural generation of terrain, which contains three separate demonstrations:

- A 2D procedural tilemap construction of an island with terrain colour being chosen based on elevation.
- A 3D procedural generation of terrain using a multimesh instance with elevation and moisture maps determining height and biome distribution.
- A second 3D procedural generation instead constructed as one continuous mesh, rather than the previous which uses voxels.
